# stable-opponent-shaping
Pytorch implementation of Stable Opponent Shaping (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyGjjsC5tQ).

Apply and compare this optimizer with other algorithms like Naive Learning (NL), Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (SGA), Consensus Optimization (CO), LookAhead (LA) and Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA). A number of games including matching pennies, iterated prisoner's dilemma and the tandem game are already implemented, but feel free to define any n-player game and compare yourself.
