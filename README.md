# stable-opponent-shaping
Pytorch implementation of Stable Opponent Shaping ([SOS](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyGjjsC5tQ)).

Apply and compare this optimizer with other algorithms like Naive Learning (NL), Symplectic Gradient Adjustment ([SGA](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v20/19-008.html)), Consensus Optimization ([CO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10461.pdf)), LookAhead (LA, see [SOS](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyGjjsC5tQ) paper) and Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness ([LOLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04326.pdf)). A number of games including matching pennies, iterated prisoner's dilemma and the tandem game are already implemented, but feel free to define any n-player game and compare yourself.
